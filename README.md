# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
### Recognize The faces And Take Automatic Attandance. :sparkles:
## Motivation :astonished:
----------------------------
This project involves building an attendance system which utilizes facial recognition to mark the presence, time-in and date of employees or student. It covers areas such as facial detection, alignment, and recognition, along with the development of a desktop application with Tkinter GUI to cater to various use cases of the system such as registration of new employees, addition of photos to the training dataset, viewing attendance reports, etc. This project intends to serve as an efficient substitute for traditional manual attendance systems. It can be used in corporate offices, schools, and organizations where security is essential.

This project aims to automate the traditional attendance system where the attendance is marked manually. It also enables an organization to maintain its records like in-time, date and attendance digitally. Digitalization of the system would also help in better visualization of the data which is stored in Excel Sheet. Its added features serve as an efficient upgrade and replacement over the traditional attendance system.

## Scope of the project ðŸš€
Facial recognition is becoming more prominent in our society. It has made major progress in the field of security. It is a very effective tool that can help low enforcers to recognize criminals and software companies are leveraging the technology to help users access the technology. This technology can be further developed to be used in other avenues such as ATMs, accessing confidential files, or other sensitive materials.
This project servers as a foundation for future projects based on facial detection and recognition. Using this system any corporate offices, school and organization can replace their traditional way of maintaining attendance of the employees and can also generate their availability(presence) report throughout the month.

## Installation :key:
-----------------------------------

#### Download

First, Download the latest version of VS Code and MySQL.

After download, Open the project using **Pycharm or VSCODE**. Then we have to create an python enviroment to run the program.

To avoid the Error, Give the path to pip by copy the path of pip.exe from folder, right click the My PC then go to properties followed by Environment variables.Click on new and add the path of there.

#### Create Enviroment

To create the Environment we have to give the path to the compiler.
In VSCode,
* Go to the view option
* Inside view Command Platter is present
* Open the command platter using Ctrl+Shift+P
* Choose select interpreter
* Then click on Enter Interpreter path
* Click on Find...
* Select the folder where python 3.10 installed
* Inside the scripts the python 3.10 is present 
* By click on it the path get selected and python environment will be created

#### Installing the packages
--------------------------------------------------
After creating the enviroment on your project let's install the necessary packages. 
To install those package open the terminal or command line and paste the code from below
```
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```
```
pip install numpy
```
```
pip install pandas
```
```
pip install Pillow
```
```
pip install python-csv
```

[ **Notice: During the package installization, sometime it shows some error, to avoid those error you can install those packages as admin. ]
